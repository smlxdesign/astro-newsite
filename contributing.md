# Contributing Guidelines

So, you want to help out? That's great, but we have some rules you'll have to agree to **before** opening an issue or pull request.

## 1. Respect our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md)

Our code of conduct is based on the popular _Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct_. That means you are probably already following it. But with that said, you should probably check once more. You can read it [here](code_of_conduct.md).

## 2. New feature, new branch

Now that you've agreed to follow the above code of conduct, you can start editing away! But before adding that new feature, please create a new branch for the feature. This also applies to bug fixes.

The name should be descriptive, but not too long as it still should be readable.

### Examples:

1. You want to add dark mode, you could name the newly created branch `feat: dark mode` or `feature/dark-mode` or anything in between. As said above, understandability and readability is the biggest priority.

2. You have found some words that are spelled wrong. You should create a new branch in this case too! You could create a new branch called something similar to `fix: spell correction` or `fix/incorrect spelling`.

The example branch names are obviously not meant to be copy-pasted. Come up with your own!
