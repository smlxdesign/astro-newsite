# Website

My new site built with [Astro](https://astro.build)!

## Why Astro?

I chose Astro since I saw it getting recommended alot. I also noticed that it was way easier to customize than other Static Site generators, such as Hugo and Jekyll.

Hugo was at first my choice for this project, but i quickly noticed that the preconfigured file structure was not going to float my boat. It was unnecesarily split up and trying to change the color of a nav link quickly turned into a week task.

## Building from source

Start off by cloning the repo locally by running this in your preffered shell:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/smlxdesign/website smlxdesign-website
```

Don't forget to `cd` into the correct folder **before** pasting this command.

Then after cloning, make sure to install the dependencies via pnpm.

```shell
pnpm install # Installing the deps
```

## Contributing

Now, when you have a local copy of the site, you can start editing away. But make sure to follow our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) as well as the [contributor covenant code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
